<p>After writing <img src="https://cozyyj.github.io/java/2022/10/06/java-nextline.html" alt="(JAVA) Can't input using nextLine()" />, this new buddy was well generated in my local server (localhost:4000), unfortunately not in the real github pageâ€¦ :(</p>

<p>It took around 2hrs to fix this ordeal!</p>

<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Check that the form of the file name (<strong>YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md</strong>) is written correctly.</li>
  <li>Add <span style="background-color: green">published: true</span></li>
</ul>
